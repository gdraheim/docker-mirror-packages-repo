## Tipps and Tricks

Probably you will not be able to build the images.

That's because docker has a so called "baseimage"
that is the source of all "image" snapshots. No
image can be bigger than the baseimage. And the
baseimage has a default size of 10GB.

Edit /etc/sysconfig/docker and increase that like

    DOCKER_OPTS="--storage-opt dm.basesize=30G"

Theoretically one can just do "service docker restart"
but in reality some versions needed the old baseimage
to be removed from disk so that it is allocated again.
