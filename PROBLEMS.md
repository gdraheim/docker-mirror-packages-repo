## Tipps and Tricks

Probably you will not be able to build the images.

That's because docker has a so called "baseimage"
that is the source of all "image" snapshots. No
image can be bigger than the baseimage. And the
baseimage has a default size of 10GB.

Edit /etc/sysconfig/docker and increase that like

    DOCKER_OPTS="--storage-opt dm.basesize=30G"

Theoretically one can just do "service docker restart"
but in reality some versions needed the old baseimage
to be removed from disk so that it is allocated again.

Oh, and by the way, switching to overlay2 does help as well:

    DOCKER_OPTS="-g /data/docker --storage-driver=overlay2"
